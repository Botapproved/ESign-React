# ESign - A Frontend-Powered E-Signature Solution 🚀

Welcome to **ESign** – the all-in-one e-signature solution that's a powerful alternative to DocuSign and OpenSign, but with a game-changing twist: **it's entirely built with Vite and React, with NO backend required!**

## 📜 Overview

Imagine a sleek, efficient e-signature app that lets you sign, send, and manage documents seamlessly—all while being super lightweight, thanks to Vite and React. Whether you’re signing documents solo or setting up custom templates with multiple roles, **ESign** is ready to streamline your workflow, no server setup needed!

## 🔥 Key Features

### Self-Signing
- **Quick Document Signing**: Upload any document, place your signature, and voila—your document is signed and ready to go!

### Advanced Template Creation
1. **Upload PDFs with Ease**: Admins can effortlessly upload a PDF for templating.
2. **Set Signature Slots and Assign Roles**: Drag, drop, and assign signature slots across pages with specific roles (e.g., “Client,” “Telemarketer”).
3. **Reusable Templates**: Save configured templates directly in a database for quick access.
4. **Generate Role-Specific Links**: Easily generate role-based links to be shared with each signer for streamlined, sequential signing.

## 🚀 Why ESign Stands Out

- **Fully Frontend**: Built with Vite + React, this app requires zero backend—no complex server configurations, no backend maintenance. Everything is handled right in the client.
- **Template Power**: Save templates and distribute links with role-specific signing access, ideal for businesses with a recurring document workflow.
- **Perfect for Scaling**: Say goodbye to server bottlenecks! ESign is designed to be fast and highly scalable, with each user’s experience happening directly in the browser.

## ⚙️ Proposed Workflow for Businesses
**Need a more robust, tailored experience? Check out how ESign's custom workflow can integrate smoothly with CRM systems!**

1. **Admin Interface for Template Creation**: Admins can upload documents, set signature fields, and assign roles, storing templates for future use.
2. **Contact Management**: Integrate with CRM contacts to automatically pull contact data—no external lists needed.
3. **Automated Document Sending**: Once a template is ready, generate signing links for each role. Once one role signs, the document flows to the next signer seamlessly.
4. **Webhook and Status Updates**: Real-time tracking and webhook integration allow the CRM to stay updated on signing status and save the final document.
